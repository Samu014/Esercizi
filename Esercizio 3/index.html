        <p class="p">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
    It has survived not only five centuries,<br>
    but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
    remaining essentially unchanged.<br>
    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets<br>
    containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> 
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like<br>
    Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>
